# <Daily Planner App>

## Description

For this project, I created an in-browser app which helps users to plan their work days. 
Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Moment, I was able to create individual time slots for hours between 9am-5pm, which include the time, a text area and save button. 
Using the save button will save the inputted content for that particular time slot to local storage, and will be available upon refresh. 

## Usage

Live deployed page: 
To use this app, enter text in the time slot areas. Saved inputs will be visible on refresh on the page.
